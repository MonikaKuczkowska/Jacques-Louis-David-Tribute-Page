            <h1>Jacques-Louis David Timeline</h1>
            <dl>
                <dt>1748</dt>
                <dd>Jacques-Louis David is born on August 30 in Paris.</dd>
                <dt>1766</dt>
                <dd>Begins studying at the French Royal Academy, where he achieves the
                    title of <i>peintre d’histoire</i> (history painter).</dd>
                <dt>1775</dt>
                <dd>Travels to the prestigious French Academy in Rome, where he refines his
                    technique by drawing the city’s ancient, Renaissance, and Baroque art
                    and architectural treasures. It is here that the young David sharpens his
                    classical aesthetic. During his five years in Rome, David produces over
                    1,000 sketches that serve as his inspiration throughout his life.</dd>
                <dt>1780</dt>
                <dd>Returns to Paris and begins a fruitful decade as one of the country’s top
                    painters, building a successful career under a system of royal and
                    aristocratic patronage. His work during this period is dominated by largescale monumental paintings.</dd>
                <dt>1785</dt>
                <dd>Achieves success at the Paris Salon with <i>The Oath of Horatii</i>, a
                    commission from Louis XVI.</dd>
                <dt>1789</dt>
                <dd>The storming of the Bastille signals the start of the French Revolution,
                    which would ultimately bring down the Bourbon monarchy and the
                    system of aristocratic privileges. Although the Revolution destabilized the
                    patronage system that sustained his career, David welcomes the
                    movement and becomes an active political participant.</dd>
                <dt>1792-94</dt>
                <dd>During the Terror, the Revolution’s most militant phase led by Maxmilien
                    Robespierre, David plays a major role as the head of the Committee for
                    General Security, which guillotined those perceived to be against their
                    revolutionary cause. In 1793, David votes for the death of Louis XVI,
                    who had once been a patron.</dd>
                <dt>1794</dt>
                <dd>David is imprisoned after a coup by moderate revolutionaries, bringing
                    an end to the Terror with the execution of Robespierre. A new, elected
                    government emerges. </dd>
                <dt>1795</dt>
                <dd>David returns to public life, taking a large studio in the Louvre and
                    reprising his role as one of the country’s most influential artists. He turns
                    away from overt politics and focuses on portraits.</dd>
                <dt>1797</dt>
                <dd>David meets Napoleon, marking the start of his long association with the
                    general.</dd>
                <dt>1799</dt>
                <dd>Napoleon seizes power in a coup d’etat, naming himself First Consul and
                    returning France to dictatorial rule.</dd>
                <dt>1800</dt>
                <dd>Napoleon rushes across the Alps in record time to fend off an Austrian
                    attack on Northern Italy. David’s painting <i>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at
                        Grand-Saint-Bernard</i> immortalizes Napoleon as a mighty general, and
                    becomes emblematic of Napoleonic power, as it still is today.</dd>
                <dt>1804</dt>
                <dd>Napoleon establishes an imperial government and crowns himself
                    emperor. For the next 10 years Napoleon’s court dictates French social
                    mores, values, and tastes in a bold attempt to refashion the world
                    according to a Napoleonic distillation of the ideal empires of the ancient
                    past. This includes the introduction of the Napoleonic code, the civil
                    code, which forms the basis of French law to this day.</dd>
                <dt>1815</dt>
                <dd>Napoleon’s reign comes to an end and the Bourbon monarchy is
                    restored.</dd>
                <dt>1816</dt>
                <dd>David is banished and flees to Brussels, where he spends the last 10
                    years of his life painting and teaching. During this period he returns to
                    mythological subjects and intimate portraiture, continuing to paint for
                    members of the Bonaparte family who were also living in exile.</dd>
                <dt>1825</dt>
                <dd>David dies on December 29 in Brussels at the age of 77. </dd>
